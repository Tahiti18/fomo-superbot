# Fixes Applied

1. Updated `src/db.ts` to properly initialize Postgres with SSL handling for Railway.
2. Corrected `tsconfig.json` to use `"module": "Node16"` and `"moduleResolution": "node16"` for ESM.
3. Added `package.additions.json` listing required deps (`pg`, `typescript`, `@types/node`).

## Next Steps

- Replace your existing `src/db.ts` with the one from this zip.
- Replace `tsconfig.json` with the one from this zip.
- Merge `package.additions.json` into your `package.json` and run:

```bash
npm install
```

- Redeploy to Railway.
